<h1>E. Peyton Sherwood</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, MO, and attended Ladue High School.  While
still in high school, I founded Keystone Computer Solutions, LP, (now dissolved)
with <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.baker">Dan Baker</a>.  I spent
some time with <a
	href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=11376390445&ref=mf">Characters
	and Company</a>, where I developed an affinity for technical theater.  I also
had a mischevious side, which manifested in, among other things, a prank that
was featured in MTV's <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=5oipdddj30M">High
	School Stories: Scandals, Pranks, and Controversies</a>.</p>

<p>From 2000 to 2004, I attended <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu">Harvard
	College</a>, where I earned an A.B. in Computer Science.  While at
Harvard, I spent a significant amount of time in technical theater.  I designed
and programmed the <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/hrdc/htdb">Harvard Theater
	Database</a> and designed the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club's first <a
	href="http://www.hrdctheater.com/index.php?query=archives&entry=6">technical
	theater requirement for actors</a>, which was ratified in Article XI of
the club's constitution.  Indeed, my theater involvement was so extensive that
Harvard magazine decided to write an article about the <a
	href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2004/07/the-wizard-of-backstage.html">Wizard
	of Backstage</a>.</p>
	
	From 2004 to 2010, I was a Vice President at <a href="http://www.deshaw.com">D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Shaw &amp; Co.</a> in New
	York City, where I was the special technology coordinator to the Chairman and CEO,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Shaw">David Shaw</a>, and
work on the firm's unified communications (including videoconferencing)
infrastructure.  I built and ran David's technical go-to team, and implemented several firmwide user-facing technologies
still in use today.
During this time, I was also involved with <a
	href="http://www.wallstreetvolunteers.org">Wall Street Volunteers</a> as an executive team member; the currently dormant
	operation connected young professionals in NYC to volunteer opportunities.  I satisfy my theater urges by supporting the <a
	href="http://www.babeltheatreproject.org/">Babel Theatre Project</a>,
started by two friends from Harvard.</p>

</p>

<p>I still (May, 2011) reside in downtown Manhattan near the South
Street Seaport.   
<p>My hobbies include mountaineering, riding my <a

	GT200</a> around the city, and running; I recently completed the <a
	href="http://www.nycmarathon.org/results/ma7/ma717.htm#17300">2007 New York City Marathon</a>.  I probably developed this sense
of adventure at <a href="http://www.hope-andrews.com/deer.htm">Deer Hollow Ranch</a>, where I attended as a camper from 1995-1996 and as
a Counselor-in-Training from 1997-1998.
