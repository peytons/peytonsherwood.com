<h1>E. Peyton Sherwood</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, MO, and attended Ladue High School.  While
still in high school, I founded Keystone Computer Solutions, LP, (now dissolved)
with <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.baker">Dan Baker</a>.  I spent
some time with <a
	href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=11376390445&ref=mf">Characters
	and Company</a>, where I developed an affinity for technical theater.  I also
had a mischevious side, which manifested in, among other things, a prank that
was featured in MTV's <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=5oipdddj30M">High
	School Stories: Scandals, Pranks, and Controversies</a>.</p>

<p>From 2000 to 2004, I attended <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu">Harvard
	College</a>, where I earned an A.B. in Computer Science.  While at
Harvard, I spent a significant amount of time in technical theater.  I designed
and programmed the <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/hrdc/htdb">Harvard Theater
	Database</a> and designed the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club's first <a
	href="http://www.hrdctheater.com/index.php?query=archives&entry=6">technical
	theater requirement for actors</a>, which was ratified in Article XI of
the club's constitution.  Indeed, my theater involvement was so extensive that
Harvard magazine decided to write an article about the <a
	href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2004/07/the-wizard-of-backstage.html">Wizard
	of Backstage</a>.</p>
	
	From 2004 to 2010, I was a Vice President at <a href="http://www.deshaw.com">D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Shaw &amp; Co.</a> in New
	York City, where I was the special technology coordinator to the Chairman and CEO,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Shaw">David Shaw</a>, and
work on the firm's unified communications (including videoconferencing)
infrastructure.  I built and ran David's technical go-to team, and implemented several firmwide user-facing technologies
still in use today.
During this time, I was also involved with Wall Street Volunteers as an executive team member; the currently dormant
	operation connected young professionals in NYC to volunteer opportunities.  I also served on the board of the
	<a href="http://www.theateronline.com/companybook.xzc?PK=1650">Babel Theatre Project</a>, started by two friends from Harvard.</p>
</p>

<p>Today (May, 2011), I reside in downtown Manhattan near the South Street Seaport.  I do freelance technical consulting
work in the areas of systems management, software development, and certain niche technical projects.  I also attend
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> part-time as a post-baccalaureate computer science student.</p>

<p>My hobbies include mountaineering, riding my

	GTS250</a> around the city, and running.  I have run the <a
	href="http://www.nycmarathon.org/">New York City Marathon</a> thrice, as well as around a dozen half-marathons and
	several shorter races.</p>
